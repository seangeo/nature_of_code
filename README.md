# Nature of Code in Rust

This project is an implementation of Daniel Shiffman's "The Nature of Code" book using Rust and the Nannou graphics library. It explores various algorithms and techniques for creating generative art and simulations of natural phenomena.

## Overview

The Nature of Code is a book that explores the algorithms behind natural phenomena like flocking, cellular automata, and particle systems. This project implements these concepts in Rust, providing interactive examples that demonstrate the principles.

## Features

- Interactive examples of various natural phenomena
- Clean, modular code structure
- Built with Nannou and egui for graphics and UI
- Easy navigation between different exercises

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Nannou dependencies (see [Nannou installation guide](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou#installation))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nature_of_code.git
   cd nature_of_code
   ```

2. Build and run the project:
   ```
   cargo run
   ```
